<br>
All this time I sink, drowning like a stone&nbsp;<br>
Tryna close my eyes, shut my ears on this throne<br>
Losing my way home, then you came along<br>
Everywhere we are, felt like where I belong<br>
<br><br>
Lost in your eyes there was no place I could hide<br>
Take me inside and let me live in your mind<br>
No pain tonight, this place is reserved for only you and I<br>
<br><br>
'Cause I wanna stay on your side<br>
Even if the world come crashing down tonight, we'll be fine<br>
Hold me close and we'll just leave it all behind<br>
Why don't you stay<br>
<br><br>
These bruises and wounds fractures on my bones<br>
Tryna fix it all but I failed all alone<br>
But just to be with you, just you lying close<br>
I can see the scars fade away on their own<br>
<br><br>
Lost in your eyes, there was no place I could hide<br>
Take me inside and let me live in your mind<br>
No pain tonight, this place is reserved for only you and I<br>
<br><br>
'Cause I wanna stay on your side<br>
Even if the world come crashing down tonight, we'll be fine<br>
Hold me close and we'll just leave it all behind<br>
Why don't you stay<br>
<br><br>
(Stay, stay) I just wanna stay here, let's just stay right here<br>
(Stay, stay) I will be okay, we can live forever in each others eyes<br>
(Stay, stay) I just wanna stay here, let's just stay right here<br>
(Stay, stay) I will be okay, we can live forever in each others eyes<br>
We can live forever, why don't we just stay, stay
